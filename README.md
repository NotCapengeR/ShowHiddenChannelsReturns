# ShowHiddenChannels Plugin Returns #
[DevilBro](https://github.com/mwittrien "ShowHiddenChannels plugin author"), author of this plugin, and BetterDiscord developers
have deleted ShowHiddenChannels plugin from the official BetterDiscord site >:C.

But this plugin still can be found in the commit history of their repository! Proof: (They removed a few lines from the config file that
were needed to plugin's work. Without them it just doesn't work even if you install the previous version from their repository)

I already save it for you, anonymous <3. You just need to download it
and follow the short instructions below.

## Installation ##
1) Download and extract the files.
2) Put «ShowHiddenChannelsReturns.plugin.js» to your plugin folder.
3) Run Discord.
4) ???
5) **Profit!!!** 

UPD: NOW DON'T NEED TO REPLACE «OBDFDB.data.json»!!!

UPD 2: DO NOT RENAME FILENAME AND IT METADATA TO «ShowHiddenChannels» — BETTER DISCORD WILL AUTO UPDATE IT!!!
